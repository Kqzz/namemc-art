# NameMC skin art tool

Tool used to generate (and apply; on the todo list) skin art to NameMC profiles. It's designed to be as easy to use as possible and require minimal user input once running. 

## Usage

> This will be updated to be much more user friendly

- Clone the repository
- Install golang
- compile the program (`go build .` in the directory your cloned)
- Replace `baseSkin.png` and `image.png` with images of your choice. `image.png` needs to be 72 x 24 pixels, and skin.png needs to be 64 x 64 pixels.
- run the namemc skin art executable file. on linux this might be: `./namemc-skin-art` or on windows you might double click it.
- apply the skins on your account from 27 to 1 (soon to be automatic ðŸ™‚)
