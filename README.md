> This will be updated to be much more user friendly

- Install golang
- compile the program (`go build .` in the directory your cloned)
- Replace `baseSkin.png` and `image.png` with images of your choice. `image.png` needs to be 72 x 24 pixels, and skin.png needs to be 64 x 64 pixels.
- run the namemc skin art executable file. on linux this might be: `./namemc-skin-art` or on windows you might double click it.
- This should generate the skins and ask if you would like to upload the skins to your account
